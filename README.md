# **About the Project:** 🛠️✨
This repository focuses on fine-tuning the LLaMA 2 model on custom datasets using LoRA and QLoRA techniques for efficient parameter optimization. It provides a robust framework for adapting state-of-the-art language models to specific tasks while significantly reducing computational requirements. With streamlined data preparation, training scripts, and interactive testing features, this project is perfect for customizing large language models (LLMs) to suit your needs. Whether you're working on text generation, classification, or other NLP tasks, this repository has you covered! 🚀📚

# **Training and Pipeline:** 💻🔧
The training pipeline is designed to handle large-scale models efficiently. By integrating LoRA and QLoRA, we freeze most of the model’s parameters and fine-tune only the lightweight adapters, minimizing resource usage. The pipeline includes steps for tokenizing and preprocessing the dataset, splitting it into train, validation, and test sets, and running training with advanced transformers' capabilities. The repository ensures flexibility, allowing you to fine-tune the model on diverse datasets with minimal computational overhead. 📈⚙️

# **Real-Time Testing**: 🎙️✅
The interactive testing script included in the repository allows users to ask questions or input prompts and receive meaningful responses from the fine-tuned model. After training, the model is seamlessly deployed for real-time testing, enabling practical use cases. The script ensures user-friendly interaction, making it simple to evaluate the model's performance on your custom data. You can iteratively test and refine the model’s behavior to achieve your desired outcomes. 🧠🤖
